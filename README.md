# Ensemble Machine Learnign Approach to Abalone Age Prediction

I created this repository to showcase some of my skills. Each folder contains a different project most of which are in Python or R.

This specific project is a simple ML approach to predictin the age of an abaloe using a number of explanatory variables.
Some of the projects are
Aim

We start by exploring, preprocessing and visualising the data. An example of this is the pairs plot below.

Ensemble Machine learning


We culminate in a ML model as shown below. The ensemble model uses a number of kernels in isolation adn in combination, theoretically giving a superior fit.

Finally we assess the importanc eof each feature in the model, and suggest som furter work as this kernal is not optimal and more could be done to improve it.
